# Notes for developers
## Code logic
The theme is built on a classes framework. The classes are identified by their group and name like this : class-[group]-[name].php.

The function tc__( $group, $classname), where the group parameter is required :
1) scans the theme folder to find the appropriate group / class 
2) and then instanciates the class(es) only once through a singleton factory.

A class typically includes a constructor which is mainly used to add the methods to WP actions and filters. 
Actions are used to render HTML or execute some code in predefined WP action, while filters are used to get values.

For simplification purposes, the theme uses few WP templates : index.php, header.php, footer.php, comments.php, sidebar(s).php. 
Those templates only includes some structural HTML markup, the rest is rendered with the actions defined in the classes of the parts/ folder.

Customizr uses one single loop for all kind of content. It is located in class-main-loop.php.


## Translation
The themes is ready for translation and already translated in french. Translation files are in /lang.
